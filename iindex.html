										<p>Although everyone seems to know what a robot is, it is hard to give a precise definition. The Oxford English Dictionary gives the following definition: “A machine
                                            capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one
                                            programmable by a computer.” This definition includes some interesting elements:
                                            • “Carrying out actions automatically.” This is a key element in robotics, but also
                                            in many other simpler machines called automata. The difference between a robot
                                            and a simple automaton like a dishwasher is in the definition of what a “complex
                                            series of actions” is. Is washing clothes composed of a complex series of actions
                                            or not? Is flying a plane on autopilot a complex action? Is cooking bread complex?
                                            For all these tasks there are machines that are at the boundary between automata
                                            and robots.

												<p>Humanoid Robots
                                                    Science fiction and mass media like to represent robots in a humanoid form. We
                                                    are all familiar with R2-D2 and 3-CPO, the robotic characters in the Star Wars
                                                    movies, but the concept goes far back. In the eighteenth century, a group of Swiss
                                                    watchmakers—Pierre and Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz and Jean-Frédéric Leschot—
                                                    built humanoid automata to demonstrate their mechanical skills and advertise their
                                                    watches. Many companies today build humanoid robots for similar reasons.
                                                    Humanoid robots are a form of autonomous mobile robot with an extremely
                                                    complex mechanical design for moving the arms and for locomotion by the legs.
                                                    Humanoid robots are used for research into the mechanics of walking and into humanmachine interaction. Humanoid robots have been proposed for performing services
                                                    and maintenance in a house or a space station. They are being considered for providing
                                                    care to the elderly who might feel anxious in the presence of a machine that did
                                                    not appear human. On the other hand, robots that look very similar to humans can
                                                    generate repulsion, a phenomenon referred to as the uncanny valley.
                                                    Humanoid robots can be very difficult to design and control. They are expensive
                                                    to build with multiple joints that can move in many different ways. Robots that use
                                                    wheels or tracks are preferred for most applications because they are simpler, less
                                                    expensive and robust.

                                                    1.5 Educational Robots
                                                    Advances in the electronics and mechanics have made it possible to construct robots
                                                    that are relatively inexpensive. Educational robots are used extensively in schools,
                                                    both in classrooms and in extracurricular activities. The large number of educational
                                                    robots makes it impossible to give a complete overview. Here we give few examples
                                                    that are representative of robots commonly used in education.
                                                    Pre-Assembled Mobile Robots
                                                    Many educational robots are designed as pre-assembled mobile robots. Figure 1.5a
                                                    shows the Thymio robot from Mobsya and Fig. 1.5b shows the Dash robot from Wonder Workshop. These robots are relatively inexpensive, robust and contain a large
                                                    number of sensors and output components such as lights. An important advantage
                                                    of these robots is that you can implement robotic algorithms “out of the box,” without investing hours in mechanical design and construction. However, pre-assembled
                                                    robots cannot be modified, though many do support building extensions using, for
                                                    example, LEGO® components.
                                                    Robotics Kits
                                                    The LEGO® Mindstorms robotics kits  were introduced in 1998.1 A kit
                                                    consists of standard LEGO® bricks and other building components, together with
                                                    motors and sensors, and a programmable brick which contains the computer that
                                                    controls the components of the robot. The advantage of robotics kits is that they a   .</p>
